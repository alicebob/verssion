<h level="2" i="2">==History==</h>
MySQL was created by a Swedish company, [[MySQL AB]], founded by [[David Axmark]], Allan Larsson and [[Michael (Monty) Widenius|Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius]]. 
Original development of MySQL by Widenius and Axmark began in 1994.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourcereleasefeed.com/interview/show/five-questions-with-michael-widenius-founder-and-original-developer-of-mysql |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313160628/http://www.opensourcereleasefeed.com/interview/show/five-questions-with-michael-widenius-founder-and-original-developer-of-mysql |archivedate=2009-03-13 |title=Five Questions With Michael Widenius – Founder And Original Developer of MySQL |publisher=www.opensourcereleasefeed.com |date= |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The first version of MySQL appeared on 23 May 1995. It was initially created for personal usage from [[mSQL]] based on the low-level language [[ISAM]], which the creators considered too slow and inflexible. They created a new [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] interface, while keeping the same [[Application programming interface|API]] as mSQL. By keeping the API consistent with the mSQL system, many developers were able to use MySQL instead of the (proprietarily licensed) mSQL antecedent.<template><title>citation needed</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>January 2014</value></part></template><template><title>dubious</title><part><name index="1"/><value>History section</value></part><part><name>reason</name><equals>=</equals><value>ISAM isn't a language, it's a method for indexing data; Also, which API was preserved?</value></part><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>January 2014</value></part></template>

<h level="3" i="8">===Deployment===</h>
[[File:LAMP software bundle.svg|thumb|400px|[[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] software bundle, displayed here together with [[Squid (software)|Squid]].]]

MySQL can be built and installed manually from source code, but it is more commonly installed from a binary package unless special customizations are required. On most [[Linux distribution]]s, the [[package management system]] can download and install MySQL with minimal effort, though further configuration is often required to adjust security and optimization settings.

Though MySQL began as a low-end alternative to more powerful proprietary databases, it has gradually evolved to support higher-scale needs as well. It is still most commonly used in small to medium scale single-server deployments, either as a component in a [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]]-based web application or as a standalone database server. Much of MySQL's appeal originates in its relative simplicity and ease of use, which is enabled by an ecosystem of open source tools such as [[phpMyAdmin]].
In the medium range, MySQL can be scaled by deploying it on more powerful hardware, such as a multi-processor server with gigabytes of memory.

There are, however, limits to how far performance can scale on a single server ('scaling up'), so on larger scales, multi-server MySQL ('scaling out') deployments are required to provide improved performance and reliability. A typical high-end configuration can include a powerful master database which handles data write operations and is [[Database replication|replicated]] to multiple slaves that handle all read operations.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |title=The future of replication in MySQL |publisher=Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=126049465932 |accessdate=9 December 2009}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The master server continually pushes binlog events to connected slaves so in the event of failure a slave can be promoted to become the new master, minimizing downtime. Further improvements in performance can be achieved by caching the results from database queries in memory using [[memcached]], or breaking down a database into smaller chunks called [[Shard (database architecture)|shards]] which can be spread across a number of distributed server clusters.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |title=Database Sharding|publisher=Code Futures |url= http://www.codefutures.com/dbshards-cloud/|accessdate=9 December 2009}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="11">===Cloud deployment===</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>Main article</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Cloud database</value></part></template>

MySQL can also be run on [[cloud computing]] platforms such as [[Amazon EC2]]. Some common deployment models for MySQL on the cloud are:

; [[Virtual machine image]]
: In this implementation, cloud users can upload a machine image of their own with MySQL installed, or use a ready-made machine image with an optimized installation of MySQL on it, such as the one provided by Amazon EC2.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | url=http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1663 | title=Running MySQL on Amazon EC2 with EBS (Elastic Block Store) | work=[[Amazon Web Services]] | accessdate=5 February 2013}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

; MySQL as a service
: Some cloud platforms offer MySQL &quot;as a service&quot;. In this configuration, application owners do not have to install and maintain the MySQL database on their own. Instead, the database service provider takes responsibility for installing and maintaining the database, and application owners pay according to their usage.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;readwriteweb&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web | first=Klint | last=Finley | url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/01/7-cloud-based-database-service.php | title=7 Cloud-Based Database Services | work=[[ReadWriteWeb]] | accessdate=9 November 2011}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Notable cloud-based MySQL services are the [[Amazon Relational Database Service]]; [[Rackspace]]; [[HP Converged Cloud]]; [[Heroku]] and [[Jelastic]].

<h level="2" i="12">==User interfaces==</h>

<h level="3" i="13">===Graphical user interfaces===</h>
A [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices or programs through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs are easier to learn than command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on the keyboard.

Third-party proprietary and free graphical administration applications (or &quot;front ends&quot;) are available that integrate with MySQL and enable users to work with database structure and data visually. Some well-known front ends are:

[[File:The MySQL Workbench startup screen.png|thumb|right|[[MySQL Workbench]] running on macOS]]
; MySQL Workbench
: [[MySQL Workbench]] is the official integrated environment for MySQL. It was developed by MySQL AB, and enables users to graphically administer MySQL databases and visually design database structures. MySQL Workbench replaces the previous package of software, [[MySQL GUI Tools]]. Similar to other third-party packages, but still considered the authoritative MySQL front end, MySQL Workbench lets users manage database design &amp; modeling, SQL development (replacing MySQL Query Browser) and Database administration (replacing MySQL Administrator).
: MySQL Workbench is available in two editions, the regular [[Free and open source software|free and open source]] ''Community Edition'' which may be downloaded from the MySQL website, and the proprietary ''Standard Edition'' which extends and improves the feature set of the Community Edition.

; Adminer
: [[Adminer]] (formerly known as phpMinAdmin) is a free MySQL front end for managing content in MySQL databases (since version 2, it also works on PostgreSQL, MS SQL, SQLite and Oracle SQL databases). Adminer is distributed under the Apache license (or GPL v2) in the form of a single PHP file (around 300 KiB in size), and is capable of managing multiple databases, with many CSS skins available. Its author is Jakub Vrána who started to develop this tool as a light-weight alternative to phpMyAdmin, in July 2007.

; Database Workbench
: [[Database Workbench]] is a software application for development and administration of multiple relational databases using SQL, with interoperationality between different database systems, developed by Upscene Productions.
: Because Databases Workbench supports multiple database systems, it can provide software developers with the same interface and development environment for these otherwise different database systems and also includes cross database tools.
: Database Workbench supports the following relational databases: Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Anywhere, Firebird, NexusDB, InterBase, MySQL and MariaDB. Database Workbench 5 runs on 32-bit or 64 bit Windows platforms. Under Linux, FreeBSD or macOS Database Workbench can operate using Wine.

; DBEdit
: [[DBEdit]] is a database editor, which can connect to an Oracle, DB2, MySQL and any database that provides a JDBC driver. It runs on Windows, Linux and Solaris. DBEdit is free and open source software and distributed under the GNU General Public License. The source code is hosted on SourceForge.

; HeidiSQL
: [[HeidiSQL]], previously known as MySQL-Front, is a free and open source client, or frontend for MySQL (and for its forks like MariaDB and Percona Server), Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL. HeidiSQL is developed by German programmer Ansgar Becker and a few other contributors in Delphi. To manage databases with HeidiSQL, users must login to a local or remote MySQL server with acceptable credentials, creating a session. Within this session users may manage MySQL Databases within the connected MySQL server, disconnecting from the server when done. Its feature set is sufficient for most common and advanced database, table and data record operations but remains in active development to move towards the full functionality expected in a MySQL Frontend.

; LibreOffice Base
: [[LibreOffice]] Base allows the creation and management of databases, preparation of forms and reports that provide end users easy access to data. Like [[Microsoft Access]], it can be used as a front-end for various database systems, including Access databases (JET), ODBC data sources, and MySQL or [[PostgreSQL]]<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | url=http://www.libreoffice.org/features/base/ | title=LibreOffice Base | accessdate=5 January 2012}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

; Navicat
: [[Navicat]] is a series of graphical database management and development software produced by PremiumSoft CyberTech Ltd. for MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQLite, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server. It has an Explorer-like graphical user interface and supports multiple database connections for local and remote databases. Its design is made to meet the needs of a variety of audiences, from database administrators and programmers to various businesses/companies that serve clients and share information with partners.
: Navicat is a cross-platform tool and works on Microsoft Windows, OS&amp;nbsp;X and Linux platforms. Upon purchase, users are able to select a language for the software from eight available languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Polish, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.

; OpenOffice.org
: [[OpenOffice.org Base]] is freely available and can manage MySQL databases if the entire suite is installed.

; phpMyAdmin
: [[phpMyAdmin]] is a free and open source tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL with the use of a web browser. It can perform various tasks such as creating, modifying or deleting databases, tables, fields or rows; executing SQL statements; or managing users and permissions. The software, which is available in 78 languages,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/translations.php|title=Translations|publisher=phpMyAdmin|date=|accessdate=2014-12-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> is maintained by ''The phpMyAdmin Project''.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/team.php|title=Team|publisher=phpMyAdmin|date=|accessdate=2013-03-03}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
: It can import data from CSV and SQL, and transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions, like displaying BLOB-data as images or download-links.

; SQLBuddy
: [[SQLBuddy]] is an open-source web-based application written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL and SQLite with the use of a Web browser. The project places an emphasis on ease of installation and a simple user interface.

; SQLyog
: [[SQLyog]] is a GUI tool available in free as well as paid versions. Data manipulations (e.g., insert, update, and delete) may be done from a spreadsheet-like interface. Its editor has [[syntax highlighting]] and various automatic formatting options. Both raw table data and a result set from a query can be manipulated. Its data search feature uses Google-like search syntax and translates to SQL transparently for the user. It has a backup tool for performing unattended backups. Backups may be compressed and optionally stored as a file-per-table as well as identified with a timestamp.

; Toad for MySQL
: [[TOAD (software)|Toad for MySQL]] is a software application from Dell Software that database developers, database administrators and data analysts use to manage both relational and non-relational databases using SQL. Toad supports many databases and environments. It runs on all 32-bit/64-bit Windows platforms, including Microsoft Windows Server, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and 8 (32-Bit or 64-Bit). Dell Software has also released a Toad Mac Edition. Dell provides Toad in commercial and trial/freeware versions. The freeware version is available from the ToadWorld.com community.

; Webmin
: [[Webmin]] is a web-based system configuration tool for Unix-like systems, although recent versions can also be installed and run on Windows. With it, it is possible to configure operating system internals, such as users, disk quotas, services or configuration files, as well as modify and control open source apps, such as the Apache HTTP Server, PHP or MySQL.
: Webmin is largely based on Perl, running as its own process and web server. It defaults to TCP port 10000 for communicating, and can be configured to use SSL if OpenSSL is installed with additional required Perl Modules.
: It is built around modules, which have an interface to the configuration files and the Webmin server. This makes it easy to add new functionality. Due to Webmin's modular design, it is possible for anyone who is interested to write plugins for desktop configuration.
: Webmin also allows for controlling many machines through a single interface, or seamless login on other webmin hosts on the same subnet or LAN.

<h level="3" i="14">===Command-line interfaces===</h>
A [[command-line interface]] is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program by typing in successive lines of text (command lines). MySQL ships with many [[command line]] tools, from which the main interface is the <template><title>Mono</title><part><name index="1"/><value>mysql</value></part></template> client.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Tool&quot;</attr><inner>[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql.html mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Tool], MySQL Reference Manual</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mysqladmin - the MySQL command-line tool&quot;</attr><inner>[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysqladmin.html mysqladmin – the MySQL command-line tool], MySQL Reference Manual</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

MySQL Utilities is a set of utilities designed to perform common maintenance and administrative tasks. Originally included as part of the MySQL Workbench, the utilities are a stand-alone download available from Oracle.

Percona Toolkit is a cross-platform toolkit for MySQL, developed in [[Perl]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|author=Home |url=http://www.percona.com/software/percona-toolkit |title=Percona Toolkit for MySQL|publisher=Percona |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Percona Toolkit can be used to prove replication is working correctly, fix corrupted data, automate repetitive tasks, and speed up servers. Percona Toolkit is included with several [[Linux]] distributions such as [[CentOS]] and [[Debian]], and packages are available for [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] as well. Percona Toolkit was originally developed as Maatkit, but as of late 2011, Maatkit is no longer developed.

<h level="2" i="15">==Application programming interfaces==</h>

Many [[programming language]]s with language-specific [[application programming interface|API]]s include [[library (computing)|libraries]] for accessing MySQL databases. These include MySQL Connector/Net for integration with Microsoft's [[Visual Studio]] (languages such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Visual Basic|VB]] are most commonly used) and the JDBC driver for Java. In addition, an [[ODBC]] interface called [[MySQL Connector/ODBC]] allows additional programming languages that support the ODBC interface to communicate with a MySQL database, such as [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] or [[Adobe ColdFusion|ColdFusion]]. The [[HTSQL]]<template><title>snd</title></template> [[Uniform resource locator|URL]]-based query method also ships with a MySQL adapter, allowing direct interaction between a MySQL database and any web client via structured URLs.

<h level="2" i="16">==Project forks==</h>
In [[software engineering]], a project fork happens when developers take a copy of [[source code]] from one [[Computer software|software package]] and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software<template><title>snd</title></template> a new (third-party) version. The term often implies not merely creating a [[branching (revision control)|development branch]], but also a split in the developer community (a form of [[Schism (religion)|schism]]).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>&quot;Schism&quot;, with its connotations, is a common usage, ''e.g.'' [http://www.jwz.org/doc/lemacs.html &quot;the Lemacs/FSFmacs schism&quot;] ([[Jamie Zawinski]], 2000), [https://lwn.net/Articles/419822/ &quot;Behind the KOffice split&quot;] (Joe Brockmeier, ''Linux Weekly News'', 2010-12-14), [http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Copyright-assignment-Once-bitten-twice-shy-1049631.html &quot;Copyright assignment - once bitten, twice shy&quot;] (Richard Hillesley, ''H-Online'', 2010-08-06), [http://dashes.com/anil/2010/09/forking-is-a-feature.html &quot;Forking is a feature&quot;] ([[Anil Dash]], 2010-09-10), [http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000101 &quot;The Great Software Schism&quot;] ([[Glyn Moody]], ''Linux Journal'', 2006-09-28), [http://mako.cc/writing/to_fork_or_not_to_fork.html &quot;To Fork Or Not To Fork: Lessons From Ubuntu and Debian&quot;] ([[Benjamin Mako Hill]], 2005).</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> MySQL forks include the following:

; WebScaleSQL
: [[WebScaleSQL]] was a software branch of MySQL 5.6, and was announced on 27 March 2014 by Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter as a joint effort to provide a centralized development structure for extending MySQL with new features specific to its large-scale deployments, such as building large replicated databases running on server farms. Thus, WebScaleSQL opened a path toward deduplicating the efforts each company had been putting into maintaining its own branch of MySQL, and toward bringing together more developers. By combining the efforts of these companies and incorporating various changes and new features into MySQL, WebScaleSQL aimed at supporting the deployment of MySQL in large-scale environments.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite web
